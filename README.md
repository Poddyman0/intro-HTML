# HTML and CSS Profile Creation

**Description:**

During this sprint, I focused on mastering the foundational skills of HTML and CSS by creating a profile page for a character or for myself. This project involved structuring a web page using HTML and styling it with CSS. I practiced reading documentation to understand different HTML tags and CSS properties and learned how to apply them effectively.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:** For structuring the content of the profile page.
- **CSS:** For styling the HTML elements and enhancing the visual presentation.
- **Documentation:** Utilized for understanding HTML tags and CSS properties.

**Features Implemented:**

- **HTML Document Structure:**
  - Created a well-structured HTML document, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
  - Implemented common HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links to build the profile content.

- **HTML Tags Usage:**
  - Applied various HTML tags like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to organize and group content.
  - Used semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>` to improve the structure and accessibility of the page.

- **CSS Styling:**
  - Linked an internal CSS file to the HTML document to apply styles.
  - Used CSS properties to set colors, fonts, margins, padding, and other visual aspects of the profile page.
  - Implemented IDs and classes to target specific elements and apply styles selectively.

- **CSS Specificity:**
  - Learned and applied CSS specificity rules to ensure styles are applied correctly and overridden where necessary.
  - Practiced using different selectors (element, class, ID) to manage and prioritize styles.
